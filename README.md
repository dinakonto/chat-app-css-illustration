# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration

## What is this?
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Frontend Mentor provides great development challenges alongside beautiful designs, enabling you to build your skills using realistic projects.

I plan to take on most, if not all, of the free challenges in order from easiest ('Newbie') to hardest ('Advanced').

## The challenge
Challenge #17<br/>
Difficulty: Intermediate

This challenge was to build out a feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the chat interface animate on the initial load *(optional)*

## My approach
I used **Javascript** to populate the chat messages, and paired it with **GSAP** to animate them in. The phone itself and other UI elements were created using **Sass**, a few divs and the `::before`/`::after` pseudo-classes.

The end product is hosted on Vercel - https://chat-app-css-illustration-delta.vercel.app/
